# OMR-Evaluation
This project focuses on Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) evaluation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Instead of traditional image segmentation, the model directly learns to detect and classify filled options from OMR sheets, making the evaluation process more robust and accurate.
